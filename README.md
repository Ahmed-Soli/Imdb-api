# Imdb-api
this api is based on the http://www.omdbapi.com service

I've used :		
1- xlsxwriter to export data to excel
2- requests to open links and get their source code
3- BeautifulSoup to parse html 
4- os to get the directory 
5- json to handle json response 

# Usage:
download the file then open cmd and type python imdb_api.py 
then the script will ask you to input the imdb link
after that you will see the progress of the process 
and finally it'll creat an excel sheet under the name of sheet.csv
